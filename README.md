# Tensorflow-Keras-CNN-Classifier
 CNN for image classification using Tensorflow.Keras

Mountain Bike and Road Bike Classifier

Built CNN from scratch using Tensorflow-Keras(i.e without using any pretrained model – like Inception).
Used CV2 for OpenCV functions – Image resizing, grey scaling.
Code developed using Jupyter Notebook – Python (ipynb)
